            <h3>Code Ninjas</h3>
            <p>For the past couple of years, I've had the privilege of fostering the creative minds of young learners through my role as the 
                lead instructor at Code Ninjas. This enriching journey has been primarily centered around teaching kids the art of coding, 
                guiding them through the fascinating realms of robotics and game development. A significant portion of my day was dedicated 
                to imparting coding skills, whether it was helping them write lines of code, debugging their ambitious projects, or assisting 
                them in devising ingenious solutions to the coding challenges they encountered.<br><br>

                Beyond the classroom, I devoted my time to crafting meticulously designed curricula for upcoming events, ensuring that each 
                learning experience was engaging and educational. I also took on the task of creating comprehensive documentation and orientation 
                materials, a valuable resource for incoming instructors. In addition to my instructional duties, I actively contributed to 
                curriculum development, prototyping robots, and conducting rigorous stress tests on these robotic creations. This allowed me 
                to anticipate and tackle potential bugs that might arise during the building process, ensuring a seamless and enriching 
                learning journey for our young coding enthusiasts. <br><br>
                
                My role at Code Ninjas has been a harmonious blend of education, creativity, and problem-solving. It's been immensely fulfilling 
                to witness the sparks of creativity ignite in young minds as they embark on their coding adventures, and to play a pivotal role in 
                nurturing their passion for technology.

                <h3>High School Robotics Coach</h3>
                <p>Beyond my role as Lead Coding Instructor at Code Ninjas, I've had the distinct honor of serving as the head coach of a dynamic
                     sustainable engineering robotics team at the Waldorf School of Orange County. In this capacity, I led a group of highly
                      motivated and talented students through the exhilarating journey of engineering, testing, and creative problem-solving 
                      within a high-intensity environment. What set our program apart was its unwavering commitment to sustainability, exemplified 
                      by our Hydrogen Fuel Cell RC car program.

                    In just our second year in the program, our team achieved a significant milestone by qualifying for an international competition 
                    held in Las Vegas, Nevada. What's even more impressive is the dedication and innovation that fueled our journey. While the rules
                     allowed for a maximum of 80 watt-hours of battery usage, our team went above and beyond by designing a car that operated solely 
                     on hydrogen. This extraordinary feat showcased our commitment to pushing the boundaries of sustainability and eco-friendly technology.

                    As head coach, my responsibilities extended beyond guiding the teams through technical challenges. I played a pivotal role in 
                    nurturing their engineering knowledge, ensuring that they comprehended the intricate details of every component on the Hydrogen 
                    Fuel Cell RC car. Our program not only emphasized engineering excellence but also instilled a deep understanding of sustainable 
                    technology. We were pioneering a new era in robotics, where innovative and eco-friendly solutions were at the forefront of our endeavors.
