            <h3>Go Kart</h3>
            <p>My biggest real engineering project is a Go Kart! It runs a 1.8kW motor and tops out 
                around 35mph (56 kph). It is almost entirely custom built, being pieced together out 
                of parts you can find out of home depot, with a couple items coming as is, such as the chassis,
                wheels, stub axle, and brakes.<br><br>

                While it currently runs on battery, I am actively working on adding a 1kW Hydrogen fuel cell
                to run the kart on hydrogen-electric power. Also in the works is a Arduino based EMS, which should 
                increase efficiency while allowing the kart to run for longer.

            <h3>H-Pattern Gear Shift</h3>
            <p>Hello there! Allow me to introduce myself – I'm Cameron Weiss, a Software Engineer from 
                Huntington Beach, California, where the sun-kissed shores meet the cutting-edge world of 
                technology. <br><br>
                I take immense pride in my journey as a self-taught expert in coding, constantly driven to 
                broaden my horizons and dive deeper into the boundless sea of knowledge. My voyage into the 
                realm of programming began at the age of 16 after gaining inspiration during a visit to 
                Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine, California headquarters. That visit ignitied an 
                unquenchable passion for coding. Without a single line of code in my repertoire, I returned 
                home, and began a quest to craft captivating digital worlds and interactive experiences. <br><br>
                
                Since that fateful day, I've painstakingly honed my craft, sharpening my ability to dissect 
                problems, think critically, and bring seemingly impossible ideas to life. But I'm not just 
                a code maestro – I'm also a guiding light in the world of engineering. I've had the privilege 
                of coaching a high school robotics team, propelling them to a coveted top 10 
                international ranking. Additionally, I've rolled up my sleeves and engineered a one-of-a-kind 
                hydrogen-electric go-kart, a testament to my inventive spirit and technical prowess. 
                
                <br><br>So, whether I'm crafting lines of code or shaping the future of engineering, 
                I'm on an exhilarating journey to push the boundaries of what's possible.
