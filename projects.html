            <h3>Go Kart</h3>
            <p>My standout engineering project is a custom Go Kart designed for speed and innovation. Powered by a 1.8kW electric motor, it 
                can reach thrilling speeds of up to 35mph (56 kph). What sets this project apart is its DIY approach, built using readily 
                available parts from my local hardware store, with only a few items sourced pre-made, such as the chassis, wheels, stub axle, and brakes.<br><br>

                Although it currently runs on batteries, I'm actively working on integrating a 1kW Hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen-electric power. 
                Additionally, I'm developing an Arduino-based Engine Management System (EMS) to enhance efficiency and extend its runtime. 
                This Go Kart represents a blend of resourcefulness, sustainability, and engineering ingenuity—an exciting journey in pushing the limits 
                of eco-friendly transportation. <br><br>

                What truly makes this project an ongoing adventure is the relentless pursuit of improvement. I'm continually exploring ways to 
                upgrade and fine-tune the Go Kart, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of speed and innovation. It's a testament to the 
                ever-evolving nature of engineering, where each modification brings new excitement and possibilities to this thrilling project.

            <h3>H-Pattern Gear Shift</h3>
            <p>One of my exciting projects revolves around enhancing my racing experience in Assetto Corsa with a custom H-pattern gear shift.
                 This Arduino-based creation combines hardware and software ingenuity to bring a touch of realism to virtual racing.<br><br>

                The heart of this project lies in Arduino's versatility. Through a clever arrangement of limit switches, my gear shift 
                can accurately read and transmit the selected gear to my computer. These limit switches act as the bridge between the physical 
                and digital worlds, ensuring that every gear shift I make is seamlessly reflected in the game.<br><br>
                
                What makes this project even more remarkable is that it's a product of 3D printing prowess. Almost every component, from the 
                intricate gear lever to the sturdy base, is meticulously crafted with 3D printed parts. It's a testament to the potential of additive 
                manufacturing in realizing complex designs.<br><br>
                
                With this H-pattern gear shift in action, I'm not just playing a racing game; I'm experiencing the thrill of realism in every 
                gear change. It's a beautiful fusion of craftsmanship, innovation, and a love for virtual racing, resulting in an immersive gaming 
                setup that elevates my racing adventures to new heights.

            <h3>Sportscar Hunter App</h3>
            <p>One of my most enjoyable and impressive projects has to be the Sportscar Hunter App. 
                Myself, along with a team of four others, embarked on a journey to develop a remarkable application that 
                harnesses the power of machine learning. This innovative app is designed to do something truly extraordinary: 
                recognize and identify the cars your phone 'sees' through its camera lens. The magic happens as the app registers 
                each car in real time, adding it to the virtual deck of cars unique to each user.<br><br>

                This functionality empowers users to curate their own collections of vehicles encountered in the real world. 
                Whether it's a sleek sports car, a classic beauty, or an exotic supercar, the app seamlessly captures and catalogues 
                these automotive gems. To accomplish this, our project leverages an expansive database, employs Flask servers for 
                efficient communication, and boasts a constantly live web-hosted user interface built using the React framework.<br><br>
                
                The beauty of the Sportscar Hunter App extends beyond its cutting-edge features. It's designed with user convenience in mind,
                 ensuring a smooth experience. Users can instantly download the app onto their smartphones, taking up minimal storage 
                 space. What's more, thanks to the image recognition AI hosted on the database side itself, the app maintains its responsive 
                 and snappy performance, delivering a delightful user experience every time it's used.

            <h3>Databse Manipulator</h3>
            <p>Hello there! Allow me to introduce myself – I'm Cameron Weiss, a Software Engineer from 
                Huntington Beach, California, where the sun-kissed shores meet the cutting-edge world of 
                technology. <br><br>
                I take immense pride in my journey as a self-taught expert in coding, constantly driven to 
                broaden my horizons and dive deeper into the boundless sea of knowledge. My voyage into the 
                realm of programming began at the age of 16 after gaining inspiration during a visit to 
                Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine, California headquarters. That visit ignitied an 
                unquenchable passion for coding. Without a single line of code in my repertoire, I returned 
                home, and began a quest to craft captivating digital worlds and interactive experiences. <br><br>
                
                Since that fateful day, I've painstakingly honed my craft, sharpening my ability to dissect 
                problems, think critically, and bring seemingly impossible ideas to life. But I'm not just 
                a code maestro – I'm also a guiding light in the world of engineering. I've had the privilege 
                of coaching a high school robotics team, propelling them to a coveted top 10 
                international ranking. Additionally, I've rolled up my sleeves and engineered a one-of-a-kind 
                hydrogen-electric go-kart, a testament to my inventive spirit and technical prowess. 
                
                <br><br>So, whether I'm crafting lines of code or shaping the future of engineering, 
                I'm on an exhilarating journey to push the boundaries of what's possible.
